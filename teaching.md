# Teaching and Mentoring

## Teaching
I've taught the following courses:
* TA Calculus 1, Spring 2024, Brown University (MATH 90).
* TA Calculus 1, Fall 2023, Brown University (MATH 90).

## Mentoring
I believe strongly in the power of mathematical mentoring. Here are some things I've done at Brown with this aim:
* Brown SPRINT Research Advisor of Joey Chun, Grace Wang and Natsuka Hayashida, Summer 2025.
* Honors thesis co-advisor of Ameer Muhialdeen, Fall 2024-Spring 2025.
* Directed Reading Project mentor:
  * Fall 2024 (Spectral Graph Theory with Nicolas Concepcion, Daniel Kyte-Zable and Jacob Mulliken).
  * Summer 2024 (Lattice Points of Polytopes with Ryan Lee and Grace Wang).
  * Spring 2024 (Matroids and Log Concavity with Ameer Muhialdeen and Smita Rajan).
  * Fall 2023 (Tropical Geometry with Ethan Bove, Ameer Muhialdeen and Smita Rajan).
  * Spring 2023 (Rep. Theory of the Symmetric Group with Nathaniel Kang and Ameer Muhialdeen).
* First year graduate student mentor:
  * Fall 2024, Alberto Landi.
  * Fall 2023, Yuhan Liu.
