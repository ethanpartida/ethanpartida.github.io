# Teaching and Mentoring

## Teaching
I've taught the following courses:
* TA Calculus 1, Spring 2024, Brown University (MATH 90)
* TA Calculus 1, Fall 2023, Brown University (MATH 90)

## Mentoring
I believe strongly in the power of mathematical mentoring. Here are some things I've done at Brown with this aim:
* Honors thesis co-advisor of Ameer Muhialdeen, Fall 2024-Spring 2025
* Directed Reading Project mentor:
  * Fall 2024 (Spectral Graph Theory with Nicolas Concepcion, Daniel Kyte-Zable and Jacob Mulliken)
  * Summer 2024 (Lattice Points of Polytopes with Ryan Lee and Grace Wang)
  * Spring 2024 (Matroids and Log Concavity with Ameer Muhialdeen and Smita Rajan)
  * Fall 2023 (Tropical Geometry with Ethan Bove, Ameer Muhialdeen and Smita Rajan)
  * Spring 2023 (Rep. Theory of the Symmetric Group with Nathaniel Kang and Ameer Muhialdeen)
* First year graduate student mentor:
  * Fall 2024, Alberto Landi
  * Fall 2023, Yuhan Liu
