## Academics
I'm currently an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota Twin-Cities. I am a double major in mathematics and computer science. I am interesed in the discrete side of mathematics and its applications. Things I have been interested in lately are: polytopes, computational algebra and geometry (macauly2), and topological data science.

I also enjoy creating over-engineered solutions to computer *"problems"*. Examples include: a fidget spinner IOT controller, smart mirror, and a work in progress machine learning cribbage bot.

Some things I'd Like to learn more about are: cryptography, algebraic geometry, Erhart polynomials, and geology.

## Personal Interests

<p>
I like to balance out my mostly stationary academic life by being outdoors as much as possible. Depending on the season I am either running, climbing, mountain biking, or skiing. Outdoor rock climbing has been my most recent obsession. I really enjoy bouldering and would like to try rope climbing as soon as I have the money to do that (this might be a long time).
