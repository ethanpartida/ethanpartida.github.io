## Academics
I'm currently an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota Twin-Cities. I am a double major in mathematics and computer science. I am interesed in the discrete side of mathematics and its applications. Things I have been interested in lately are: polytopes, simplicial complexes, and computational algebra and geometry.

I also enjoy creating over-engineered solutions to computer *"problems"*. Examples include: a fidget spinner IOT controller, smart mirror, and a machine learning cribbage bot.

Some things I'd Like to learn more about are: Algebraic Geometry, Symmetric Functions and Geology.

<p>
I like to balance out my mostly stationary academic life by being outdoors as much as possible. As of late this has been through rock climbing and hiking (to rock climbing). I'm always looking for more partners so let me know if you would like to go cragging.
