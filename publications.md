* <dt>Algebraic Cobordism rings of Wonderful Varieties and Matroids (with <a href="https://rajgandhi97.github.io/">Raj Gandhi</a>)</dt> <dd>FPSAC abstract avaliable upon request</dd>
<dd>
 We prove a Feichtner-Yuzvinsky presentation and a simplicial presentation for the algebraic cobordism ring $\Omega^*(M)$ of the toric variety of the Bergman fan of any loopless matroid $M$. As a consequence of our simplicial presentation, we obtain a ring isomorphism $\Omega^*(M) \simeq CH^*(M) \otimes \Omega^*(pt)$ where $CH^*(M)$ is the Chow ring of $M$ and $\Omega^*(pt)$ is the algebraic cobordism ring of a point. This isomorphism generalizes, in part, the exceptional integral-isomorphism between the Chow ring and K-ring of a matroid, studied in the recent works of Berget--Eur--Spink--Tseng and Larson--Li--Payne--Proudfoot. If $M$ is the matroid of a complex hyperplane arrangement $H$, we prove that the algebraic cobordism ring of the wonderful variety $W_H$ of $H$ is isomorphic to $\Omega^*(M)$. In this case, both rings coincide with the complex cobordism ring of $W_H$.

* <dt>Graded Ehrhart Theory of Unimodular Zonotopes (with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/colincrowley/home">Colin Crowley</a>)</dt><dd>FPSAC abstract avaliable upon request</dd>
<dd>
 Graded Ehrhart theory is a new $q$-analogue of Ehrhart theory based on the orbit harmonics method. We study the graded Ehrhart theory of unimodular zonotopes from a matroid-theoretic perspective. Generalizing a result of Stanley (1991), we prove that the graded lattice point count of a unimodular zonotope is a q-evaluation of its Tutte polynomial. We conclude that the graded Ehrhart series of a unimodular zonotope is rational and obeys graded Ehrhart--Macdonald reciprocity. In an algebraic direction, we prove that the harmonic algebra of a unimodular zonotope is a coordinate ring of its associated arrangement Schubert variety. Using the geometry of arrangement Schubert varieties, we prove that the harmonic algebra of a unimodular zonotope is finitely generated and Cohen--Macaulay. We also give an explicit presentation of the harmonic algebra of a unimodular zonotope in terms of generators and relations. We conclude by classifying which unimodular zonotopes have Gorenstein harmonic algebras. Our work answers, in the special case of unimodular zonotopes, two conjectures of Reiner and Rhoades (2024).

* <dt><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12291">Line Shellings of Geometric Lattices</a> (with <a href="https://www.uvm.edu/~sbackman/">Spencer Backman</a>, <a href="https://galen.dorpalen-barry.org/">Galen Dorpalen-Barry</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/anastasianathanson/home">Anastasia Nathanson</a> and Noah Prime)</dt>
<dd>Inspired by Bruggesser-Mani's line shellings of polytopes, we introduce line shellings for the lattice of flats of a matroid: given a normal complex for a Bergman fan of a matroid induced by a building set, we show that the lexicographic order of the coordinates of its vertices is a shelling order. This gives a new proof of Björner's classical result that the order complex of the lattice of flats of a matroid is shellable, and demonstrates shellability for all nested set complexes for matroids. </dd>

* <dt><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07810">Shifted and Threshold Matroids</a></dt><dd>
In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dam.2025.08.038"> Discrete Applied Mathematics, Volume 378, 2026 </a> </dd><dd> <dd>We characterize the class of threshold matroids by the structure of their defining bases. We also give an example of a shifted matroid which is not threshold, answering a question of Deza and Onn. We conclude by exploring consequences of our characterization of threshold matroids: We give a formula for the number of isomorphism classes of threshold matroids on a groundset of size n. This enumeration shows that almost all shifted matroids are not threshold. We also present a polynomial time algorithm to check if a matroid is threshold and provide alternative and simplified proofs of some of the main results of Deza and Onn. </dd>

* <dt><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12291">On the topology of conormal complexes and posets of matroids</a> (with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/anastasianathanson/home">Anastasia Nathanson</a>)</dt> <dd> To appear in SIAM J. Discrete Math </dd>
<dd>We introduce the poset of biflats of a matroid $M$, a Lagrangian analog of the lattice of flats of $M$, and study the topology of its order complex, which we call the biflats complex. This work continues the study of the Lagrangian combinatorics of matroids, which was recently initiated by work of Ardila, Denham and Huh. We show the biflats complex contains two distinguished subcomplexes: the conormal complex of $M$ and the simplicial join of the Bergman complexes of $M$ and $M^*$, the matroidal dual of $M$. Our main theorems give sequences of elementary collapses of the biflats complex onto the conormal complex and the join of the Bergman complexes of $M$ and $M^*$. These collapses give a combinatorial proof that the biflats complex, conormal complex and the join of the Bergman complexes of $M$ and $M^*$ are all simple homotopy equivalent. Although simple homotopy equivalent, these complexes have many different combinatorial properties. We collect and prove a list of such properties.</dd>

* <dt><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10462">Computing Rational Powers of Monomial Ideals</a> (with Pratik Dongre, Benjamin Drabkin, Josiah Lim, Ethan Roy, Dylan Ruff, Alexandra Seceleanu and Tingting Tang)</dt> <dd>
Polymath 2020. In the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsc.2022.08.018"> Journal of Symbolic Computation, Volume 116, 2023 </a> </dd><dd>We provide multiple algorithms for computing the rational powers of monomial ideals. We also generalize rational powers to allow for real powers. We prove that given any monomial ideal, the function taking a real number to the corresponding real power is a left continuous step function with rational discontinuity points. </dd>

# Writings

Here are some writings I've done:

* <dt><a href="https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/227132"> Playing Cribbage with Reinforcement Learning and Minimax </a> </dt> <dd>
We create a program to play the card game cribbage. To do this, we implement and compare to different algorithms. One algorithm attempts to teach itself cribbage through reinforcement learning. It teaches itself poorly. The other algorithm uses a stochastic minimax algorithm to great effect.</dd>

* <dt><a href="/mcnairPaper.pdf">Symmetry of a Pastry: A Mathematical Investigation into the Braid Group</a></dt><dd> <a href="https://www.cehd.umn.edu/trio/mcnair/2020/partida/">McNair Scholar Program 2020 </a></dd><dd> An expository overview of the braid group created during the 2020 McNair program. We first introduce the symmetric group and braid group using many tikz diagrams. We then look at their applications to cryptography (it is non-commutative) and knot theory (Alexander's theorem).</dd>
