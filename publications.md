* <dt><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10462">Computing Rational Powers of Monomial Ideals</a></dt> <dd>
Polymath 2020. In the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsc.2022.08.018"> Journal of Symbolic Computation Volume 116, 2023 </a> </dd><dd>We provide multiple algorithms for computing the rational powers of monomial ideals. We also generalize rational powers to allow for real powers. We prove that given any monomial ideal, the function taking a real number to the corresponding real power is a left continuous step function with rational discontinuity points. </dd>

* <dt><a href="https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/227132"> Playing Cribbage with Reinforcement Learning and Minimax </a> </dt> <dd>
We create a program to play the card game cribbage. To do this, we implement and compare to different algorithms. One algorithm attempts to teach itself cribbage through reinforcement learning. It teaches itself poorly. The other algorithm uses a stochastic minimax algorithm to great effect.</dd>

* <dt><a href="/mcnairPaper.pdf">Symmetry of a Pastry: A Mathematical Investigation into the Braid Group</a></dt><dd> <a href="https://www.cehd.umn.edu/trio/mcnair/2020/partida/">McNair Scholar Program 2020 </a></dd><dd> An expository overview of the braid group created during the 2020 McNair program. We first introduce the symmetric group and braid group using many tikz diagrams. We then look at their applications to cryptography (it is non-commutative) and knot theory (Alexander's theorem).</dd>
