## Code
I often write code to work on math projects. Below are some links:

This code computes the conormal complex and ring of a matroid. It also provides tools to work the building blocks of these objects, the biflats and biflags of a matroid.

## DRP
I am a big fan of directed reading programs (DRPs). I was a participant in them as an undergraduate and have mentored four such programs as a graduate student. Check out the Brown DRP! I'll include a link to the website when I find it. For now, feel free to ask me about it.
