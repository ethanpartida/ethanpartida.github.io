# More Things

## Code
I often write code to work on math projects. Below are some links:
* <dt><a href="https://github.com/ethanpartida/Conormal">Conromal Complexex and Rings</a></dt> <dd> 
This code computes the conormal complex and ring of a matroid. It also provides tools to work the building blocks of these objects, the biflats and biflags of a matroid.</dd>

## DRP
I am organizing the <a href="https://sites.google.com/brown.edu/drp-brown-math/home?authuser=0">Brown DRP</a> with Eric Zhu. If you are an undergraduate at Brown and might be interested in math, you should check it out!
