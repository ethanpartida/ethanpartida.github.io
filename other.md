# Bobs and Bits

## Code
I often write code to work on math projects. Below are some links:
* <dt><a href="https://github.com/ethanpartida/Conormal">Conromal Complexex and Rings</a></dt> <dd> 
This code computes the conormal complex and ring of a matroid. It also provides tools to work the building blocks of these objects, the biflats and biflags of a matroid.</dd>


## DRP
I am a big fan of directed reading programs (DRPs). I was a participant in them as an undergraduate and have mentored four such programs as a graduate student. Check out the Brown DRP! I'll include a link to the website when I find it. For now, feel free to ask me about it.

## Teaching
I've taught the following courses:
* TA Calculus 1, Spring 2024, Brown University (MATH 90)
* TA Calculus 1, Fall 2023, Brown University (MATH 90)
