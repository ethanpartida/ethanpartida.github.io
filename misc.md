# Miscellaneous


Here are links to miscellaneous things I've done:

1. <a href="/category_theory.html">Category Theory</a>: In the spring of 2020, I participated in the University of Minnesota Twin-Cities directed reading program. I worked with graduate student Trevor Karn and we read Fong and Spivak's Category Theory textbook. This was my take on an intro to the basic ideas of category theory. I'd like to return to this subject now that I have more math experience. Having some algebraic topology experience, I've seen the power of these generalizations and I'd love to see more.
