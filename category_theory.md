## Category Theory
___

Over the spring semester of 2020 I had the
pleasure of reading "An Invitation to Applied Category Theory"(CITE) through
the University of Minnesota's Directed Reading Program. This was my
first real exposure to abstract math and it was quite an eye
opening experience. Quite surprisingly, my biggest takeaway from this reading was
not a complex theorem or result but a new way of thinking about
problems. Fong and Spivak emphasize how the often overwhelming
abstractness of category theory is its most valuable feature. This is shown by the ease at which category theory is applied to a multitude of different problems (hence the *Applied*
Category Theory). Below, I hope to introduce you to the groundwork of
category theory and give you and idea of what this mystical *new way
of thinking* is.

"So what is Category Theory?" I found myself asking as I began this
reading. Roughly, Category Theory is the study of structures and
things which act on those structures. "OK you just described all of
Math, and literally any science", my more critical readers might be
thinking. Well the truth is, that's the whole point of category
theory. The generality of the ideas found in category theory allow
themselves to be applied to an almost endless supply of more concrete
fields and give a different categorical view on those fields.

A Category, C, is a mathematical structure which consists of two
parts.  A collection of things called objects and denoted Ob(C). This
is very much like a set, except there are special cases where this can be
bigger due to weird set theory paradoxes. Along with this, for every 2
objects, x and y, we specify a set hom(x,y), called the morphisms for
x to y. This can be thought of
kind of like functions from x to y except, you guessed it, much more
*general*. There also has to be some notion of an identity morphisms
and compositions of morphisms, but these are more tangental from the
idea of a category.

Of course all these defintions and words make little sense without
examples. The framework of a category is incredibly versitile and can
encapsulate pretty much any mathematical idea. Try clicking around
below to see what is hiding inside these three different categories.

Since a Category is a mathematical structure, we'd like ways to
transform one category into another. Lucky for us there is a way to do
this, functors! In simplest terms, a functor is a a map between
categories. It sends objects to objects and morphisms to
morphisms. This photo from the great [Bartosz
Milewski](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2015/01/20/functors/) sums up
the idea of functors really great. \

As we can see there are two categories, C and D. C has objects a and b
with a morphism f:a->b. Our functor, F, sends a->F(a), b->F(b), and
f->F(f). Importantly, F perserved our morphisims in C and mapped them
to D. In other words, f:a->b in C implies that there exists an
F(f):F(a)->F(b). This notion is very important to functors and help
them perserve cool ideas that are the foundations of cateogry theory.



In a [talk]((http://www.ams.org/notices/200902/rtx090200212p.pdf)) about the history of mathematics, Freeman Dyson
interestingly opens "Mathematics needs both birds and frogs". Birds
view math soaring high in the sky, seeing broad concepts which unify
all of our mathematical theories. Frogs view the nitty gritty bits of
our mathematical world and dedicate themselves to a specific part of
our mathematical land. Category Theory is whole heartdly a bird field
of mathematics. In fact it might even be a [RÃ¼ppell's
vulture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%BCppell%27s_vulture)
field of mathematics. Regardless of this, I belive at least of working knowledge of
category theory is essential for a career in mathematics. Because even
if your destiny is to be a frog, it always helps to be a frog with a periscope.
