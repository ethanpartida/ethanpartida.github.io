The Undergraduate Mathematics Research Seminar (UMRS) is a seminar hosted by the University of Minnesota math department for undergraduates pursuing research, interested in research, or who are just interested in learning more mathematics. We provide a low stakes environment for students to practice giving mathematics talks. All mathematical topics are welcome, including non-original research. We will be meeting most Thursdays at 2:30pm in Vincent Hall 215. If you'd like to be updated on the seminar, see the mailing list above.
