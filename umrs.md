The Undergraduate Mathematics Research Seminar (UMRS) is a seminar hosted by the University of Minnesota math department for undergraduates pursuing research, interested in research, or who are just interested in learning more mathematics. We provide a low stakes environment for students to practice giving mathematics talks. All mathematical topics are welcome, including non-original research. The fall 2021 schedule is still TBD, similarly with the location. If you'd like to be updated on this, see the mailing list above. To see the 2021-2020 schedule see <a href="https://themodularperspective.com/outreach-spring-2021/">here</a>, and the 2019-2020 schedule <a href="https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/umrsfall2019/home">here</a>.
