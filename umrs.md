* **When**: Thursdays 2:30pm
* **Where**: Vincent 215

The Undergraduate Mathematics Research Seminar (UMRS) is a seminar hosted by the University of Minnesota math department for undergraduates pursuing research, interested in research, or who are just interested in learning more mathematics. We provide a low stakes environment for students to practice giving mathematics talks. All mathematical topics are welcome, including non-original research. We will be meeting most Thursdays at 2:30pm in Vincent Hall 215. If you'd like to be updated on the seminar, see the mailing list above. To see the 2021-2020 schedule see <a href="https://themodularperspective.com/outreach-spring-2021/">here</a>, and the 2019-2020 schedule <a href="https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/umrsfall2019/home">here</a>.

Talk Schedule:
* September 23rd: Harper Niergarth, A Lack of Numerical Semigroups on the Kunz Polyhedra.
  > Abstract: A numerical semigroup is a cofinite subset of the non-negative integers that is closed under addition and contains zero. The Kunz Polyhedra, P_m, are a family of rational polyhedra whose integer points are in bijection with numerical semigroups with fixed smallest nonzero element m. Each face of P_m corresponds to a poset that describes the structure of the numerical semigroups found on that face. Interestingly, some faces of P_m do not have any integer points on them, but are still associated with a poset. In this talk, we will explore why these faces do not have integer points on them by looking at their posets.
